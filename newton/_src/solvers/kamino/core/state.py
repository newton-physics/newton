class State:
    """
    Represents the time-varying state of a :class:`Model` in a simulation.

    The State object holds all dynamic quantities that change over time during simulation,
    such as rigid body poses, twists, and wrenches, as well as joint coordinates, velocities,
    and constraint forces.

    State objects are typically created via :meth:`kamino.Model.state()` and are used to
    store and update the simulation's current configuration and derived data.

    For constrained rigid multi-body system, the state is defined formally using either:
    1. maximal-coordinates, as the absolute poses and twists of all bodies expressed in world coordinates, or
    2. minimal-coordinates, as the joint coordinates and velocities along with the
       pose and twist of a base body when it is a so-called "floating-base" system.

    In Kamino, we formally adopt the maximal-coordinate formulation in order to compute the physics of the
    system, but we are also interested in the state of the joints for the purposes of control and analysis.

    Thus, this container incorporates the data of both representations, and in addition also includes the per-body
    total (i.e. net) wrenches expressed in world coordinates, as well as the joint constraint forces. Thus, it
    provides a complete description of the dynamic state of the constrained rigid multi-body system.

    We adopt the following notational conventions for the state attributes:
    - Generalized coordinates, whether maximal or minimal, are universally denoted by ``q``
    - Generalized velocities for bodies are denoted by ``u`` since they are twists
    - Generalized velocities for joints are denoted by ``dq`` since they are time-derivatives of ``q``
    - Wrenches (forces + torques) are denoted by ``w``
    - Constraint forces are denoted by ``lambda`` since they are effectively Lagrange multipliers
    - Subscripts ``_i`` denote body-indexed quantities, e.g. :attr:`q_i`, :attr:`u_i`, :attr:`w_i`.
    - Subscripts ``_j`` denote joint-indexed quantities, e.g. :attr:`q_j`, :attr:`dq_j`, :attr:`lambda_j`.
