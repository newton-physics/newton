        Build a contact manifold between two convex shapes using perturbed support mapping and polygon clipping.

        This function generates up to 4 contact points between two colliding convex shapes by:
        1. Finding contact polygons using perturbed support mapping in 6 directions
        2. Clipping the polygons against each other in contact plane space
        3. Selecting the best 4 points using rotating calipers algorithm if more than 4 exist
        4. Transforming results back to world space with feature tracking

        The contact normal is the same for all contact points in the manifold. The two shapes
        must always be queried in the same order to get stable feature IDs for contact tracking.

        Args:
            geom_a: Geometry data for the first shape.
            geom_b: Geometry data for the second shape.
            quaternion_a: Orientation quaternion of the first shape.
            quaternion_b: Orientation quaternion of the second shape.
            position_a: World position of the first shape.
            position_b: World position of the second shape.
            p_a: Anchor contact point on the first shape (from GJK/EPA).
            p_b: Anchor contact point on the second shape (from GJK/EPA).
            normal: Contact normal vector pointing from shape A to shape B.
            feature_anchor_a: Feature ID of the anchor point on shape A. Can pass in 0 if anchor tracking is not needed.
            feature_anchor_b: Feature ID of the anchor point on shape B. Can pass in 0 if anchor tracking is not needed.
            data_provider: Support mapping data provider for shape queries.

        Returns:
            A tuple containing:
            - int: Number of valid contact points in the manifold (0-4).
            - wp.vec4: Penetration depths for each contact point (negative when shapes overlap).
            - wp.types.matrix((4, 3), wp.float32): Contact points at the center of the manifold contact
              (midpoint between points on shape A and shape B) in world space.
            - wp.vec4i: Feature IDs for each contact point, enabling contact tracking across
              multiple frames for warm starting and contact persistence.

        Note:
            The feature IDs encode geometric information about which features (vertices, edges,
            or edge-edge intersections) each contact point represents, allowing the physics
            solver to maintain contact consistency over time.
