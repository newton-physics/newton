Support mapping functions for collision detection primitives.

This module implements support mapping (also called support functions) for various
geometric primitives. A support mapping finds the furthest point of a shape in a
given direction, which is a fundamental operation for collision detection algorithms
like GJK, MPR, and EPA.

The support mapping operates in the shape's local coordinate frame and returns:
- The support point (furthest point in the given direction)
- A feature ID that identifies which geometric feature (vertex, edge, face) the point lies on

Supported primitives:
- Box (axis-aligned rectangular prism)
- Sphere
- Capsule (cylinder with hemispherical caps)
- Ellipsoid
- Cylinder
- Cone
- Plane (finite rectangular plane)
- Convex hull (arbitrary convex mesh)
- Triangle

The module also provides utilities for packing mesh pointers into vectors and
defining generic shape data structures that work across all primitive types.
