# Project Lessons

## 2026-07-29 — Keep the primary checkout aligned with the user's daily branch

- Context: Configuring this Newton fork as the editable source for Isaac Sim 6.0.1.
- Mistake: Kept `main` at `/home/limx/github/newton` and placed the actual development branch in a hidden `.worktrees/` path, adding unnecessary friction to the user's normal solver workflow.
- Rule: When the user only needs one compatibility branch for daily development, make the canonical repository path check out that branch. Keep other branches available remotely or as Git refs unless the user explicitly asks for simultaneous local checkouts.

## 2026-07-29 — Distinguish integration mechanics from solver design

- Context: The user asked how CUDA code is embedded into Newton.
- Mistake: Redirected the discussion into choosing solver algorithms and joint scope instead of explaining the concrete CUDA/Warp integration boundary.
- Rule: When asked how native or GPU code plugs into an existing framework, first explain the exact module, kernel, launch, state, and export path. Discuss numerical-method design only if the user asks for it afterward.
