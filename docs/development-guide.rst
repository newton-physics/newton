Development Guide
=================

This document is a guide for developers who want to contribute to the project or understand its internal workings in more detail.

Environment setup
-----------------

Clone the repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    git clone git@github.com:newton-physics/newton.git
    cd newton

Using uv
^^^^^^^^

`uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_ is a Python package and project manager.

Install uv:

.. tab-set::
    :sync-group: os

    .. tab-item:: macOS / Linux
        :sync: linux

        .. code-block:: console

            curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

    .. tab-item:: Windows
        :sync: windows

        .. code-block:: console

            powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

Run basic examples:

.. code-block:: console

    # An example with basic dependencies
    uv run newton/examples/example_quadruped.py

    # An example that requires extras
    uv run --extra dev newton/examples/example_humanoid.py

When using uv, the `lockfile <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/layout/#the-lockfile>`__
(``uv.lock``) is used to resolve project dependencies
into exact versions for reproducibility among different machines.

Sometimes, a dependency in the lockfile needs to be updated to a newer version.
This can be done by running ``uv lock --upgrade-package <package-name>``:

.. code-block:: console

    uv lock --upgrade-package warp-lang

    uv lock --upgrade-package mujoco-warp

uv also provides a command to update all dependencies in the lockfile:

.. code-block:: console

    uv lock -U

Remember to commit ``uv.lock`` after running a command that updates the lockfile.

Using venv
^^^^^^^^^^

These instructions are meant for users who wish to set up a development environment using `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__
or Conda (e.g. from `Miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>`__).

.. tab-set::
    :sync-group: os

    .. tab-item:: macOS / Linux
        :sync: linux

        .. code-block:: console

            python -m venv .venv
            source .venv/bin/activate

    .. tab-item:: Windows (console)
        :sync: windows

        .. code-block:: console

            python -m venv .venv
            .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

    .. tab-item:: Windows (PowerShell)
        :sync: windows-ps

        .. code-block:: console

            python -m venv .venv
            .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Installing dependencies including optional ones:

.. code-block:: console

    python -m pip install mujoco --pre -f https://py.mujoco.org/
    python -m pip install warp-lang --pre -U -f https://pypi.nvidia.com/warp-lang/
    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp.git@main
    python -m pip install -e .[dev]

Run basic examples:

.. code-block:: console

    # An example with basic dependencies
    python newton/examples/example_quadruped.py

    # An example that requires extras
    python newton/examples/example_humanoid.py

Running the tests
-----------------

The Newton test suite supports both ``uv`` and standard ``venv`` workflows,
and by default runs in up to eight parallel processes. On some systems, the
tests must be run in a serial manner with ``--serial-fallback`` due to an
outstanding bug.

Some tests rely on optional dependencies (like `usd-core <https://pypi.org/project/usd-core/>`__) and will be skipped if not installed.  
Pass ``--help`` to either runner to see all available flags.

.. tab-set::
    :sync-group: env

    .. tab-item:: uv
        :sync: uv
        
        .. code-block:: console

            # install all extras and run tests
            uv run --extra dev -m newton.tests

    .. tab-item:: venv
        :sync: venv

        .. code-block:: console

            # install dev extras (including testing & coverage deps)
            python -m pip install -e .[dev]
            # run tests
            python -m newton.tests

To generate a coverage report:

.. tab-set::
    :sync-group: env

    .. tab-item:: uv
        :sync: uv

        .. code-block:: console
            
            # append the coverage flags:
            uv run --extra dev -m newton.tests --coverage --coverage-html htmlcov

    .. tab-item:: venv
        :sync: venv

        .. code-block:: console

            # append the coverage flags and make sure `coverage[toml]` is installed (it comes in `[dev]`)
            python -m newton.tests --coverage --coverage-html htmlcov

The file ``htmlcov/index.html`` can be opened with a web browser to view the coverage report.

Code formatting and linting
---------------------------

`Ruff <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/>`_ is used for Python linting and code formatting.
`pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ can be used to ensure that local code complies with Newton's checks.
From the top of the repository, run:

.. tab-set::
    :sync-group: env

    .. tab-item:: uv
        :sync: uv

        .. code-block:: console

            uvx pre-commit run -a

    .. tab-item:: venv
        :sync: venv

        .. code:: console

            python -m pip install pre-commit
            pre-commit run -a

To automatically run pre-commit hooks with ``git commit``:

.. tab-set::
    :sync-group: env

    .. tab-item:: uv
        :sync: uv

        .. code-block:: console

            uvx pre-commit install

    .. tab-item:: venv
        :sync: venv

        .. code:: console

            pre-commit install

The hooks can be uninstalled with ``pre-commit uninstall``.

Building the documentation
--------------------------

To build the documentation locally, ensure you have the documentation dependencies installed.

.. tab-set::
    :sync-group: env

    .. tab-item:: uv
        :sync: uv

        .. code-block:: console

            rm -rf docs/_build
            uv run --extra docs sphinx-build -W -b html docs docs/_build/html

    .. tab-item:: venv
        :sync: venv

        .. code:: console

            python -m pip install -e .[docs]
            cd path/to/newton/docs && make html

The built documentation will be available in ``docs/_build/html``.

Testing documentation code snippets
-----------------------------------

The ``doctest`` Sphinx builder is used to ensure that code snippets in the documentation remain up-to-date.

The doctests can be run with:

.. tab-set::
    :sync-group: env

    .. tab-item:: uv
        :sync: uv

        .. code-block:: console

            uv run --extra docs sphinx-build -W -b doctest docs docs/_build/doctest

    .. tab-item:: venv
        :sync: venv

        .. code:: console

            python -m sphinx -W -b doctest docs docs/_build/doctest

For more information, see the `sphinx.ext.doctest <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html>`__
documentation.

Style Guide
-----------

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code.
- Use Google-style docstrings (compatible with Napoleon extension).
- Write clear, concise commit messages.
- Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or bug fix.
- Use kebab-case instead of snake_case for command line arguments, e.g. ``--use-cuda-graph`` instead of ``--use_cuda_graph``.

Roadmap and Future Work
-----------------------

(Placeholder for future roadmap and planned features)

- Advanced solver coupling
- More comprehensive sensor models
- Expanded robotics examples

See the `GitHub Discussions <https://github.com/newton-physics/newton/discussions>`__ for ongoing feature planning.

Benchmarking with airspeed velocity
-----------------------------------

The Newton repository contains a benchmarking suite implemented using the `airspeed velocity <https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ framework.
The full set of benchmarks are intended to be run on a machine with a CUDA-capable GPU.

To get started, install airspeed velocity from PyPI:

.. code-block:: console

    python -m pip install asv

If airspeed velocity has not been previously run on the machine, it will need to be initialized with:

.. code-block:: console

    asv machine --yes

To run the benchmarks, run the following command from the root of the repository:

.. code-block:: console

    asv run --launch-method spawn main^!

The benchmarks discovered by airspeed velocity are in the ``asv/benchmarks`` directory. This command runs the
benchmark code from the ``asv/benchmarks`` directory against the code state of the ``main`` branch. Note that
the benchmark definitions themselves are not checked out from different branchesâ€”only the code being
benchmarked is.

Tips for writing benchmarks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rather than running the entire benchmark suite, use the ``--bench BENCH, -b BENCH`` flag to filter the benchmarks
to just the ones under development:

.. code-block:: console

    asv run --launch-method spawn main^! --bench example_anymal.PretrainedSimulate

The most time-consuming benchmarks are those that measure the time it takes to load and run one frame of the example
starting from an empty kernel cache.
These benchmarks have names ending with ``time_load``. It is sometimes convenient to exclude these benchmarks
from running by using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    asv run --launch-method spawn main^! -b '^(?!.*time_load$).*'

While airspeed velocity has built-in mechanisms to determine automatically how to collect measurements,
it is often useful to manually specify benchmark attributes like ``repeat`` and ``number`` to control the
number of times a benchmark is run and the number of times a benchmark is repeated.

.. code-block:: python

    class PretrainedSimulate:
        repeat = 3
        number = 1

As the airspeed documentation on `benchmark attributes <https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writing_benchmarks.html#benchmark-attributes>`__ notes,
the ``setup`` and ``teardown`` methods are not run between the ``number`` iterations that make up a sample.

These benchmark attributes should be tuned to ensure that the benchmark runs in a reasonable amount of time while
also ensuring that the benchmark is run a sufficient number of times to get a statistically meaningful result.

The ``--durations all`` flag can be passed to the ``asv run`` command to show the durations of all benchmarks,
which is helpful for ensuring that a single benchmark is not requiring an abnormally long amount of time compared
to the other benchmarks.
